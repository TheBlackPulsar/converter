# Converter

A simple converter I coded at the beginning of my studys to practice haskell and switch numbers between the number systems (decimal, hexadecimal, octal and binary)

To use it simply execute the .exe file and enter the conversion you want to do

> decimal x to hexadecimal
>
> decimal x to octal
>
> decimal x to binary
>
> hexadecimal x to decimal
> 
> hexadecimal x to octal
> 
> hexadecimal x to binary
>
> octal x to decimal
>
>  octal x to hexadecimal
>
> octal x to binary
>
>  binary x to decimal
>
>  binary x to hexadecimal
>
>  binary x to octal
